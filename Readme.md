This code is a web application that allows the user to add, update, and delete products using CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).

Prerequisites
The code requires a running server to fetch data from and send data to. It is assumed that the server is running on http://localhost:3000/products.
Functionality
The code has the following functionality:

getAllProducts() function fetches all the products data from the server and displays it in a table format on the webpage. It also adds the product names to a dropdown list.
handleAddProduct(e) function is called when the user submits the "Add Product" form. It creates a new product object with the form data and sends a POST request to the server to add the product.
addProducts(productObj) function sends a POST request to the server to add a new product with the object productObj as its body.
updateProduct(id, updatedProduct) function sends a PATCH request to the server to update the product with the given id with the new updatedProduct.
deleteProduct(productId) function sends a DELETE request to the server to delete the product with the given productId. It also removes the product from the DOM.
Usage
To use the code, simply run a server on http://localhost:3000/products and open the index.html file in a web browser. You can then add, update, and delete products on the webpage.
